In collaboration with Michelle McQuaidâ€™s group, we have engaged in a multi-year partnership with the University of Melbourne Centre for Wellbeing Science to advance the science of well-being. Our joint efforts have extended across multiple organizations, driving initiatives to enhance well-being in diverse settings. Through our work, we have published several peer-reviewed papers on PERMA+4 measurement, employing advanced methodologies such as item response theory and a systems-informed approach. Our research not only deepens the understanding of well-being dimensions but also provides practical tools for organizations committed to fostering thriving, resilient communities.
