At Donaldson Measurement Group, we are pioneering research in economic security and well-being. In partnership with The Good Foundry, our team is developing and validating a multidimensional scale that extends the PERMA+4 framework to include critical economic stability factors such as income consistency, job security, and financial resilience. Leveraging rigorous literature reviews, international survey data, and advanced statistical analyses in R, our research delivers actionable insights that enhance both personal and workplace outcomes. Our innovative approach bridges cutting-edge psychometrics with applied positive psychology, empowering organizations to cultivate healthier, more resilient communities.
