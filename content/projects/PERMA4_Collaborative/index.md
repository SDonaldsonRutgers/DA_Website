Led by Dr. Stewart I. Donaldson and Dr. Scott I. Donaldson, the PERMA+4 Collaborative offers innovative measurement scales and practical tools to assess and nurture the nine building blocks of well-being and positive functioning. Building on Professor Martin Seligman’s original PERMA model, PERMA+4 expands the framework to include additional dimensions that predict optimal performance at work, school, and in life. Our global community of researchers and practitioners shares resources, validated scales, and peer-reviewed scientific findings to promote well-being and vitality worldwide. Explore our site for definitions, validated tools, and key publications—or email Stewart.Donaldson@cgu.edu to join the initiative free of charge.
