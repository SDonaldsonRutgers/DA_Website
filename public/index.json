Donaldson and Donaldson (2021a) added four additional domains (physical health, mindset, environment, economic security; PERMA + 4). Psychometric development and testing of the original, translated, and variant versions of the measure have relied on Classical Test Theory approaches, such as factor analytic methods. In the workplace, valid, brief measures are critical. The current study used item response theory to analyze data from a large sample of Canadian (n = 1,003) and Australian (n = 942) employees to create a 9-item short scale of PERMA + 4. A graded response model showed good item discrimination (a \u003e 1.40), and similar test information compared to the full measure. A short scale of PERMA + 4 will be useful for future studies of the building blocks of well-being and positive functioning, as well as for evaluating well-being programs and interventions within the workplace.","tags":["Featured"],"title":"The PERMA+4 Short Scale - A Cross-Cultural Empirical Validation Using Item Response Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"7ecb8177635d38596d2cf04dbe2a1889","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/about/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Stewart Donaldson","Llewellyn van Zyl","Scott I.

The current study used multitrait-multimethod analyses to examine the relationship between positive work and organizations constructs PERMA+4 and work role performance (adaptivity, proactivity, and proficiency) beyond self-report and monomethod bias. Findings from 221 coworker pairs demonstrated strong positive convergence between self-reported and collateral-reported PERMA+4 (r \u003e .85) and work role performance (r\u003e.85), including organizational adaptivity (r \u003e .71), organizational proactivity (r \u003e .68), and organizational proficiency (r \u003e .73). PERMA+4 was also a significant predictor of overall work role performance. A multitrait-multimethod matrix showed that monomethod trait interrelationships were systematically higher than heteromethod trait interrelationships with inflated correlations ranging from .07 to .20. Monomethod parameter estimates and coefficients of determination were generally higher than in bias corrected self-reports, knowledgeable collateral-reports, and heteromethod parameter estimates. The results provide support for the validity of the relationship between PERMA+4 and work role performance, and suggest the importance of including procedural design and statistical control methods in workplace surveys to correct for self-report and monomethod bias.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Examining PERMA+4 and Work Role Performance beyond Self-Report Bias: Insights from Multitrait-Multimethod Analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stewart Donaldson","Saeideh Hesmati","Scott I.

However, Seligman (2018) suggested the original five building blocks are highly predictive of well-being but certainly not exhaustive. This research attempted to expand the PERMA model in the workplace with four new building blocks of well-being - physical health, mindset, environment, and economic security. Study 1 utilized nine subject matter experts (SMEs) to content analyze and evaluate an item pool for scale development. In Study 2 (N=300), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) extrapolated nine dimensions of positive functioning at work (PF-W) with a random sample of full-time employees recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The purpose of Study 3 was to validate the PF-W scale and test its ability to predict work outcomes. Findings from 727 full-time employees supported a general factor of PF-W with nine lower-order dimensions. The measure exhibited convergent, discriminant, criterion, predictive, and incremental forms of validity with other well-being (Diener 1985; Luthans, Youssef and Avolio 2007) and performance measures (Griffin, Neal and Parker 2007), as well as measurement invariance across job function. The Positive Functioning at Work Scale provides a comprehensive measurement tool that can inform future workplace programs and interventions. It also predicts important work outcomes, such as turnover intentions, job-related affective well-being, plus individual, team, and organizational adaptivity, proactivity, and organizational proficiency.","tags":[""],"title":"The Positive Functioning at Work Scale: Psychometric Assessment, Validation, and Measurement Invariance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

This empirical study was designed to clarify several issues that have emerged in these recent articles. Using a multi-trait multi-method (MTMM) research design with 220 knowledable co-worker pairs (N = 440), it was found that the 5 PERMA building blocks of well-being (positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment) and 4 additional potential building blocks of well-being (physical health, mindset, environment, and economic security) significantly predicted SWB above and beyond self-report and mono-method bias. This is one of the first empirical studies to test the PERMA building blocks of well-being beyond the sole use of self-reports, and illustrates that the building blocks can be strong predictors of well-being in some populations.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Examining Building Blocks of Well-Being Beyond PERMA and Self-Report Bias","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stewart Donaldson","Scott I.

Numerous empirical studies have been conducted in recent years to verify the effects of these interventions. This paper provides a systematic review and the first meta-analysis of PPIs at work, highlighting intervention studies explicitly aligned within the theoretical traditions of positive work and organizations (PWO). We draw from streams of PWO, including positive organizational scholarship (POS), positive organizational behavior (POB) and positive organizational psychology literature (POP) to evaluate PPIs at work. The meta-analytic findings from 22 studies showed that the five workplace positive psychology interventions had a small positive effect on improving desirable work outcomes (g = .25), and a small to moderate effect on reducing undesirable work outcomes (g = −.34). Thus, this paper provides valuable insight on the effectiveness of PPIs at work and future directions for scholars and practitioners.","tags":["Featured"],"title":"Evaluating Positive Psychology Interventions at Work: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott I.

One aspect of PWO includes positive psychology interventions (PPI’s) at work, which uses the theory and scholarship of positive work and organizations to design interventions aimed at improving employee work outcomes. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Donaldson, Lee, and Donaldson (under review) found a link between PPI’s at work and improving desirable and reducing undesirable work outcomes. The purpose of this chapter was to synthesize the empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions using a theory-driven evaluation (TDE) approach. TDE refers to the systematic use of substantive knowledge (i.e., social science theory, stakeholder theory, or some combination of both) about the intervention under consideration to improve, produce knowledge, or determine its merit, value, and worth (Donaldson, 2007). We found that positive psychology theories, intervention delivery methods, types of participants, and contexts in which these interventions are implemented determines the efficacy of their outcomes. The findings will have implications for enhancing the effectiveness of future interventions as well as provide valuable information for practitioners deciding to use PPI’s in their organizations.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"The Effectiveness of Positive Psychology Interventions in the Workplace: A Theory-Driven Evaluation Approach","type":"publication"}]
